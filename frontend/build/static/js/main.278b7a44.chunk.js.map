I didn’t lead the project but really pushed to become the project’s Code Monkey.</p>\n        <p>After playing around a lot with data science in university and even competing in a data science hackathon (and getting crushed by some masters students) this was my first chance to apply what I’d learned on real world data.

We ended up clustering on several quantitative variables trying to find specific user groups and found out that Tandem users are very very different. This was my second lesson - real world data doesn’t always play nice and give nice neat correlations. </p>\n        <p>We ended up taking some clearer clusters and then extracting some other groups that we knew existed in Tandem (such as pro users, expats, etc) and dug deeper into them. </p>\n        <p>At the time, I was working remotely from Canada as a result of travel-during-covid-gone-wrong and was waking up at 4/5am every day to hop into Python and explain the results and do further analyses with the Product Team.

I liked it so much that while on exchange in Barcelona I decided to run for President for the next year. Thankfully myself and my Co-President won and had the tricky task of budgeting, planning, and hiring as 15 member team with a 9-hour time difference. </p>\n        <p>Despite the chaos it felt like at the time - we managed to start the year with a team of 15 passionate students and had successfully raised more money from companies (like RBC, EY, V4C, and more) than any other year before. </p>\n        <p>Luckily the chaos didn’t stop there, and we arranged ran a code-free Hackathon, speaker series with entrepreneurs, startup tours + talks, panels, and networking nights. The single most stressful moment occurred at CEO Dinner Night, a dinner with 45 of Vancouver’s most important CEOs and startup execs and 45 of Vancouver’s most eager students. We spent the day racing around buying everything we needed, receiving endless catering orders, figuring out how to purchase a keg of beer for the guests, and setting everything up in the offices of a coding bootcamp. After 10 hours of running around - I got on stage to introduce myself, eProjects, and the event to Vancouver’s business leaders and a room full of my peers. As quite a nervous public speaker this was terrifying but ended up actually being a lot of fun hosting the night. It went fine but I did accidentally play ABBA through the office speakers when I plugged in my PowerPoint. </p>\n        <p>My personal favorite event was  the hackathon where we had 50 students forming teams to come up with the best business plan, design, and presentation in 8 hours to be judged by a panel consisting of a VC, CEO, and an EY consultant (because they gave us the $$$ and we love them).</p>\n        <p>I really consider it to be my first *real* taste of tech because I got to do everything from design, coding, “management”, project management, sales, fundraising, marketing, and everything else that goes into running a year’s 10 large events.</p>\n        <ArticleImage image={\"eprojects.png\"} class=\"text-center\" description=\"Some of my ePals\"/>\n        <p>It was an amazing experience and I met some of my best friends through it.

I then quite obsessively studied Spanish, got to low-level-gringo-fluency and came back to Canada to obsess over both Spanish and coding.</p>\n        <p>In my last year of university, I felt quite stretched by studying my final year of a finance + economics degree, running <Link to=\"/project/2\" className=\"article-link tn\"> eProjects</Link>, and trying to learn as much about Spanish and web development as I could. So I decided the next logical step would be to graduate, move to a country where very little English is spoken, where I can work hands on as a software engineer. After a quick Google search for my criteria of “cleanest” Spanish, lowest levels of English, highest levels of safety, and tech hubs, I eventually settled on either Lima, Bogota, and Medellín. </p>\n        <p>I got a job with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://getvico.com/\" className=\"article-link\">VICO (Viviendas Compartidas)</a> - a marketplace for student/young professional housing in Colombia. The team was around 20 people, and they had just entered into the Latin American version of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://500.co\" className=\"article-link\">500 Startups</a>. I had one interview with one of the founders, we got on very well, and I bought a plane ticket for Colombia the day after my graduation ceremony.</p>\n        <p>The first few weeks, I was hitting everyone with “perdón no entendí”s, speaking horribly accented Spanglish, and getting thrown head first into React having never studied it previously. It was the steepest learning curve of my entire life and I loved it. </p>\n        <p>I worked on whole features from scratch primarily using React with PHP (Laravel).

It’s a Chrome Plugin that shows you all the hidden subtitles on Netflix shows and lets you display two sets of subtitles at once. Or you can just show foreign language subtitles and click on each word for a translation. It is a lot easier to learn Spanish watching Narcos than doing endless flashcards.</p>\n        <p>---</p>\n        <h4><a className=\"article-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tandem.net/\">Tandem</a></h4>\n        <p>Obviously, I have to recommend Tandem. It is extremely stressful at first seeing messages come in and not really knowing how to reply to them and heavily relying on Google Translate but you will be surprised how quickly you improve. Once you feel more comfortable chatting over Tandem Chat you should try to meet up with someone in person or have a call to practice. It’s scary but the only way to get experience really speaking the language! Also in my opinion it is one of the easiest ways to make friends in a new city. Also the app is obviously stunning and only getting better by the day.</p>\n        <p>---</p>\n        <h4><a className=\"article-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apps.ankiweb.net/\">Anki</a></h4>\n        <p>The last and most mind-numbing tool in my arsenal is Anki. When you finish Lingvist and just need some more niche or customized vocabulary - Anki is the place to go. I took words I didn’t know from Netflix shows, made vocab sheets in Google Sheets, and imported them into Anki. It’s mind-numbing going through thousands of flashcards but incredibly helpful. I promise you at some point you will be surprised you can watch Netflix and recognize 99% of the words.</p>\n        <p>---</p>\n        <h4><a className=\"article-link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://radioambulante.org/en\">Radio Ambulante</a></h4>\n        <p>Also a Spanish specific resource: Radio Ambulante. It’s an incredible podcast where Latin Americans share interesting stories about their lives or countries. It also has subtitles so you can read along and add to your Anki deck ;). It is also super helpful as basically every episode has a new Spanish accent so you can start to recognize them and become more used to Spanish in general rather than one specific kind. <a className=\"article-link\" href=\"https://radioambulante.org/audio/ciudad-infinita.\">Here is my favorite episode</a> which convinced me to travel to Lima.</p>\n        <p>---</p>\n        <p>I’m planning to start learning Portuguese in about a year’s time when I feel okay about my German (hopefully).
