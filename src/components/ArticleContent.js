        <p>As the title suggests - I had a minor identity crisis throughout university and decided that the world of high finance <Emoji emoji="üìà" desc="chart"/> was not for me and I instead wanted to do something in tech. At the time, I was under the impression that tech companies were software developers and accountants and nothing in between. So over the course of three years, I went from struggling to understand the difference between margins and tabs to making practice projects in JavaScript and competing in a <a className="article-link" href="http://www.lumohacks.com">hackathon</a> (placing a cool 15th place).</p>
        <p>I became mildly obsessed with learning to code and after about a year of learning I put it to the side to learn Spanish while on exchange in Barcelona, Spain (my now favorite city on the planet).  I then quite obsessively studied Spanish, got to low-level-gringo-fluency and came back to Canada to obsess over both Spanish and coding.</p>
        <p>In my last year of university, I felt quite stretched by studying my final year of a finance + economics degree, running <Link to="/project/2" className="article-link tn"> eProjects</Link>, and trying to learn as much about Spanish and web development as I could. So I decided the next logical step would be to graduate, move to a country where very little English is spoken, where I can work hands on as a software engineer. After a quick Google search for my criteria of ‚Äúcleanest‚Äù Spanish, lowest levels of English, highest levels of safety, and tech hubs, I eventually settled on either Lima, Bogota, and Medell√≠n. </p>
        <p>I got a job with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://getvico.com/" className="article-link">VICO (Viviendas Compartidas)</a> - a marketplace for student/young professional housing in Colombia. The team was around 20 people, and they had just entered into the Latin American version of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://500.co" className="article-link">500 Startups</a>. I had one interview with one of the founders, we got on very well, and I bought a plane ticket for Colombia the day after my graduation ceremony.</p>
        <p>The first few weeks, I was hitting everyone with ‚Äúperd√≥n no entend√≠‚Äùs, speaking horribly accented Spanglish, and getting thrown head first into React having never studied it previously. It was the steepest learning curve of my entire life and I loved it. </p>
        <p>I worked on whole features from scratch primarily using React with PHP (Laravel). I also got to learn SQL to do some data analysis and testing. In my 4-month tenure in Colombia, I‚Ä¶</p>
        <ul>
          <li key="1">Developed a modal feature to schedule appointments for apartment viewings using custom React components along with ones from Airbnb and Google libraries.</li>
          <li key="2">Developed a new booking process with some of the slickest most time-consuming CSS animations I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of developing.</li>
          <li key="3">Pitched, designed, and developed all the backend and frontend for a user Profile feature where users can better get to know who they will be living with. Got to draw how the database would work on a whiteboard and felt like a proper #hacker.</li>
          <li key="4">Endless new screens and modals across the site along with constant CSS design tweaks.</li>
          <li key="5">Learned a lot and endlessly annoyed my coworkers with questions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It was also really cool to really feel comfortable in Spanish and get deep into such a different culture. I learned how to dance salsa (super badly), befriended the old Colombian ladies living next to me and got invited to Colombian dinners, drank a lot of coffee, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://micheladas.info/colombiana/," className="article-link">put salt in my beer</a>, and saw a lot of lizards. The experience was amazing and I left having accomplished my goal of feeling comfortable in Spanish and feeling like a half-competent developer</p>
